The term open source refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.
The term originated in the context of software development to designate a specific approach to creating computer 
programs. Today, however, "open source" designates a broader set of values—what we call "the open source way.
" Open source projects, products, or initiatives embrace and celebrate principles of open exchange, collaborative 
participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented development.
"Source code" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers 
can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a "program" or "application"—works. Programmers who have access 
to a computer program's source code can improve that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't 
always work correctly.
